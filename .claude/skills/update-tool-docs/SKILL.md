description: Update README.md tools section and fupd() function with documentation and upgrades for brew and uv managed tools
---

Update the README.md tools section to document tools from Brewfile (brew managed) and uv tool list (uv managed). Also updates the README.md setup section with `uv tool install` commands and the `fupd()` function in `foundation/.foundation` with `uv tool upgrade` commands. Short-circuits if no changes needed.

## Step 1: Check if Work is Required

Read/gather data from:
1. **Brewfile**: Extract all tool names from `brew "toolname"` and `cask "toolname"` lines
2. **uv tool list**: Run `uv tool list` to get installed uv tools (format: `toolname vX.Y.Z`)
3. **README.md tools section**: Extract tool names from both numbered lists (homebrew managed and uv managed). For uv tools with extras, parse `[tool-name](url)\[extra\]` format and extract as `tool-name[extra]`
4. **README.md setup section**: Extract `uv tool install` commands (may include extras like `"dvc[gdrive]"`)
5. **foundation/.foundation fupd()**: Extract `uv tool upgrade <toolname>` commands from the fupd() function (may include extras like `"dvc[gdrive]"`)

Compare these lists:
- If all Brewfile tools are documented AND Brewfile is sorted AND all uv tools are documented AND uv tools section is sorted AND README.md setup section has correct uv tool install commands AND fupd() has all uv tool upgrades sorted, report "No changes needed" and **exit early**
- Otherwise, continue to Step 2

## Step 2: Parse and Sort Brewfile

Extract all tool names from Brewfile, separating into:
- **Brew tools**: lines matching `brew "toolname"`
- **Cask tools**: lines matching `cask "toolname"`

Sort each list alphabetically by tool name.

## Step 3: Reformat Brewfile

Rewrite Brewfile with sorted entries:
- Header comment: `# Foundation CLI/TUI tools - sorted alphabetically`
- All `brew "toolname"` entries (sorted alphabetically)
- Blank line
- Header comment: `# Casks - sorted alphabetically`
- All `cask "toolname"` entries (sorted alphabetically)

Example:
```ruby
# Foundation CLI/TUI tools - sorted alphabetically
brew "atuin"
brew "bat"
brew "btop"

# Casks - sorted alphabetically
cask "claude-code"
cask "karabiner-elements"
```

## Step 4: Generate Documentation for New Tools

For tools not yet documented in README.md (either brew or uv section), use web search to find:
- GitHub repository URL (preferred) or official website
- Brief description of what the tool does

Format each entry as:
```
1. [tool-name](url) - description
```

For uv tools with extras (e.g., `dvc[gdrive]`), format as:
```
1. [tool-name](url)\[extra\] - description
```
The `\[extra\]` is escaped to display literally in Markdown. When extracting tool
names for `fupd()` upgrade commands, combine them as `tool-name[extra]` (unescaped).

Rules:
- No bold on links
- No leading articles ("a", "an")
- No capitalization of first word (unless proper noun)
- No ending punctuation
- Keep descriptions short and concise
- Keep numbered list in alphabetical order by tool name
- Delete any placeholder entries (e.g., "1. tbd")
- **Line wrapping**: Maximum 80 columns per line. Wrap at word boundaries
    (never split words). Use 4-space indentation for continuation lines.
    Prefer breaking after punctuation or natural phrase boundaries when possible

Example of wrapped entry:
```
1. [tool-name](https://github.com/org/tool) - description that needs to
    wrap to the next line with 4-space indentation
10. [another-tool](https://github.com/org/another) - longer description
    that wraps correctly for double-digit items too
```

## Step 5: Update Files

1. Write the sorted Brewfile if changes were needed
2. Merge new brew/cask tool docs into "homebrew managed tools:" section, maintaining alphabetical order
3. Merge new uv tool docs into "uv managed tools:" section, maintaining alphabetical order
4. Update README.md setup section with `uv tool install` commands for all uv managed tools
5. Update `fupd()` in `foundation/.foundation` with sorted uv tool upgrade commands

Both sections in README.md follow the same format under "## tools":
```markdown
## tools

here's a summary of the core cli/tui/gui foundation tools:

homebrew managed tools:

1. [tool-name](url) - description
...

uv managed tools:

1. [tool-name](url) - description
...
```

The `fupd()` function in `foundation/.foundation` should include uv tool upgrades after
`uv self update`, sorted alphabetically:

```bash
function fupd() {
    echo "updating foundation tools..."
    brew update && brew upgrade
    nvim --headless "+Lazy! update" +qa
    uv self update
    uv tool upgrade "dvc[gdrive]"
    uv tool upgrade tool-b
    uv tool upgrade "tool-c[extra]"
    claude update
}
```

Rules for fupd():
- Place `uv tool upgrade` commands immediately after `uv self update`
- Sort tool names alphabetically (by base tool name, e.g., `dvc[gdrive]` sorts as `dvc`)
- For tools with extras, use double quotes: `uv tool upgrade "dvc[gdrive]"`
- Tools without extras don't need quotes: `uv tool upgrade tool-name`
- Keep `claude update` as the last command

The README.md setup section should include `uv tool install` commands for each uv managed tool.
Look for the numbered setup steps and update the uv tool installation step(s) to match the
current uv managed tools list:

```markdown
4. install uv managed tools:

    ```bash
    uv tool install "dvc[gdrive]"
    uv tool install another-tool
    ```
```

Rules for setup section:
- For tools with extras, use double quotes: `uv tool install "dvc[gdrive]"`
- Tools without extras don't need quotes: `uv tool install tool-name`
- List each tool on its own line within the code block
- Keep the step description generic (e.g., "install uv managed tools:")

## Output

Report:
- "No changes needed" if short-circuited
- Otherwise: number of new tools documented (brew and uv separately), whether setup section was updated, number of uv tool upgrades added to fupd(), any tools where documentation could not be found
